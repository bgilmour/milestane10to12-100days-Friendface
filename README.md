# Milestone10to12 (Friendface)

This is an implementation of the milestone challenge which was to retrieve JSON data from a server, parse it into some useful data strutures, and display it in a navigable UI. As I developed the UI (initially using a local file containing the JSON data) I refactored the main view into reusable view components that reduced duplication and helped ensure consistency in the UI. I used a local function to transform the array of Friend structs into an array of User structs. This made it simple to navigate from the firends list in the user details view to a detail view for for the friend. The published User array is wrapped inside a FriendfaceData class that conforms to ObservableObject. The FriendfaceData object is created in the main view in a StateObject wrapper which allows it to be injected into the environment allowing it to be accessed in the user detail view (it's required to create the user list from the Friend array).

The milestone challenge follows on from projects 10 to 12 in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)).
